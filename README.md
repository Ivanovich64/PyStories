# PyStories
A series of interactive stories that change as you take decisions or make up your own. Small project.

# Game Mechanics
## Decisions
There are some decisions throughout the game that might change from a small portion to the entire development of the story. Most decisions affect only the path of the current chapter, but there are some key paths that lead to a significant change in the whole direction of the story.

## Zentrum
The most important characteristics, values and decisions of the character compose the Zentrum. It describes the core of the character in the game, and is the main source for presenting dialogue, path or action options. That way the game learns a little bit about the character and shapes the path for the player.
From choosing a special name all the way to whether picking up a seemingly unimportant item can lead to a major difference in the gamplay experience.
